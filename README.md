# netscied-web

`netscied-web` hosts the source code behind the Network Science Education Initiative in Taiwan [website](https://netscied.tw).

The goal of this project is to make network science accessible and _fun_ for all abilities,
through the collection of network datasets, tutorials and syllabuses, 
and open models of practical use cases.

The site is served by an [Amazon S3 bucket](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Hosting for this site is personally funded. Any offers to host them would be kindly considered :-).
